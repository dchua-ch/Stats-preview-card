## My process
I marked up and styled the mobile layout first. The mobile layout consists of an image and a div with text wrapped in a containing div, with class ".text-container". I then turned .text-container into a flexbox container. The desktop layout was implemented by using a media query and changing the flex-direction.  

### Built with


- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
As mentioned earlier, this is my first time I've implemented a design in HTML/CSS. As such, I've managed to learn and practice many of the basics for the first time. It is also my first time using Git and GitHub to manage the version control of a project.  

I struggled with getting some parts of the design correct. Most notably the positioning of the elements. I highlight some of the challenges I overcame below.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

1. Responsive layout using FlexBox
The responsive layout was achieved by changing the flex-direction from column in mobile mode to row-reverse in desktop mode.
```css
.flex-container {
    /* Mobile layout */
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: nowrap; 
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    width:70%;
    min-width: var(--mobile-min-width);
}

@media screen and (min-width: 922px){
    .flex-container{
        flex-direction: row-reverse;
        width: 100%;

    }
    ...
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
